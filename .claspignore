# .claspignore
# Ignore everything by default, then allow only files needed for a Google Apps Script project

# Ignore all files

# Keep the clasp ignore file and clasp config itself
!.claspignore
!.clasp.json

# Keep the Apps Script manifest and source files (GS/JS/HTML/CSS)
!appsscript.json
!*.gs
!*.js
!*.html
!*.css

# The lines above are the important part: only the manifest and script/html/css files
# will be uploaded by `clasp push`. The rest of this file lists common dev files so
# they are clearly excluded (mostly redundant because of the '*' rule above).
